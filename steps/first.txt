LISTS AND RECORDS
A list displays a set of records from a table. You can identify table data in the form of rows and columns. Each row represents one record. Each column represents one field. 

Lists can be filtered and customized to display the information you need.

Select the plus (+) signs to learn more about each of the menus accessible in a list.




A view is a version of a customized list or form which defines which fields appear and in what order. Your list views may vary depending on your role in the Platform. For list views, the number of records displayed for the table does not change. However, the fields and their order may differ.


Default view on the list of Incidents

Views enable users to quickly display the same list or form in multiple ways. To switch between different views of columns on a list (as shown to your left), open the List controls menu and select View. Then select the name of the desired view. 

If the view is anything other than the Default view, the view name appears in brackets beside the table list title (ex. Incidents View: Mobile).



A list that is displayed to a user for the first time will be sorted by one of the following: 

The order field, if one is present in the table
The number field, if one is present in the table
The name field, if one is present in the table
To sort in ascending or descending order, select the caret (up or down arrow) icon next to the column name. You may also sort a column by selecting the Column options icon (three vertical dots) and sort (a to z) or (z to a). Select the left and right arrows below to toggle between the different sort options.



List anatomy

Although lists display data captured in different tables, their interface remains consistent with common features. 


All Incidents filtered so that the 'Assignment group' and 'Assigned to' fields are not empty

1
Title bar: Displays the list title and view name (when not on the default view), as well as search list values. The filter icon allows you to create custom filters on your list. The gear icon allows you to personalize the list. 

2
Breadcrumbs: Offers a quick form of filter navigation. Breadcrumbs are created by using the condition builder to apply filters to a list (see next lesson, "Filters and Tags").

3
Column header search: Provides a search within a specific column.

4
Column headers: Displays the title (field on a form) of the column.

5
Field values: Right-click on a field value to access additional actions. 

List personalization (logged-in user)

Personalize a list to show or hide fields on a view, as well as change the list column order for the current logged-in user. Select the Personalize List (gear) icon in the list header. Personalization should be used for temporary situations. The Personalize List modifies the layout of a list for an individual user. It does not affect the Platform default. 


Personalize list icon

Once you select the personalize list icon, a list collector (Personalize List Columns) will open. Once you are done personalizing your list, select OK to save the changes. 


Personalize List Columns

The following can be done through Personalize List Columns:

Add or remove columns: In the Available section, select the columns to add to your list. In the Selected section, you may select each column you would like to remove. 
Rearrange columns: In the Selected section, select the column(s) you want to reorder and use the up or down icons to place the columns in the desired order. 
Reset column defaults: Return the list's columns to the default view.
Once a list is personalized, the Personalize List (gear) icon will have a solid dot at the bottom of the gear. If you hover over it, the message, "Update Personalized List" will appear.

Editing multiple records

Select any field on a record and then press the Shift key on your keyboard, and use your mouse to select multiple fields in a column to edit multiple records. You can also press the Shift key, click and drag multiple records in a column, to edit multiple records in a list. 

The Platform will inform you of how many records will be changed. When done, save the changes.  In this example, we change 5 records to be In Progress.
